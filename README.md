# Contributing ❤️
There's a reason this is open source, we'd love for you to throw your ideas into here!

‼️ Before you jump in, here's a few gotcha's ‼️

- ✋ Make sure you work off the development branch! Every release is a merge of development into master!
- 😎 Please throw up an issue that your pull request addresses. Issues are a great way to communicate what needs to be done!
- 😇 Feel free to submit your pull request before you are even done developing, it's a great way to prematurely get some other eyes looking over your work!
